# ToDoListApps
MAD Final Exams

Created using:
1. Volley (Consuming API from [MGM Laboratory Website](https://mgm.ub.ac.id/todo.php)
2. RecyclerView (Showing Data)
3. Thread (To Simulate loading when fetching data)

Before jumping into implementation, here are the system design. Started by creating use-case diagram, activity diagram, and then a sequence diagram.

FYI: System was developed based on the system design.

P.S.: System design was done by my own understanding, if there is a miss or something off please pardon my so-little-knowledge. 
Im currently still learning and trying to be better everyday by learning from every mistake i made.
