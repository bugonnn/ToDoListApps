# ToDoListApps
MAD Final Exams

Created using:
1. Volley (Consuming API from [MGM Laboratory Website](https://mgm.ub.ac.id/todo.php)
2. RecyclerView (Showing Data)
3. Thread (To Simulate loading when fetching data)

Before jump into implementation, here are the system design. Started from creating use-case diagram, activity diagram and then sequence diagram.

FYI: System was developed based on the system design. (Can i call myself software engineer now?ðŸ¤ª)

P.S.: System design was done by my own understanding, if there is a miss or something off please pardon my so-little-knowledge. 
Im currently still learning and trying to be better everyday by learning from every mistakes i made.

Also, i want to thanks my very cool lecturer [Aryo Pinandito, S.T., M.MT, Ph.D](https://github.com/aryoxp) for teaching me mobile development in this whole semesterðŸ¤˜
